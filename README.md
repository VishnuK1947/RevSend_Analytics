Troy Labs Hackathon: Data Analytics and Growth Strategies for Revsend

Two Important Ways to tackle the problem:

1. Company's feedback
2. Customer's feedback (ex. employees of the company)
   There is an underlying assumption that company's feedback includes the customer's feedback and buulds upon it based on it's system-based feedback. At the end of the day, our direct employee is the company and our first step of growth would be towards the company's responses which includes it's customers'.

To gain a holistic view of customer behavior and preferences, RevSend should collect data from multiple sources:

CRM Data: Utilize the one-click OAuth integration with HubSpot or Salesforce to access customer interaction and transaction history.
Platform Usage Data: Collect data on how customers interact with the RevSend platform, including gift selections, customization choices, and feature usage.
Customer Surveys: Conduct periodic surveys to gather direct feedback on customer satisfaction, preferences, and needs.
Sales Data: Analyze sales data, including gift types, frequencies, and values.
Customer Support Interactions: Log and categorize customer support requests and issues.
